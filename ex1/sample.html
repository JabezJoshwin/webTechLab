                The Seagram Building is both beloved and controversial and a paragon of modernist architecture and the International Style. Its sleek glass and bronze exterior, combined with an innovative use of space, set a standard for skyscraper design, embodying Mies van der Rohe’s famous dictum “less is more.” It sits across from Gordon Bunshaft’s equally innovative (and arguably more beautiful) glass curtain wall building, the Lever House. If you want to understand midcentury modern architecture, just spend some time ogling at the corner of 53rd and Park Avenue.

                The Seagram Building, completed in 1958, is a landmark skyscraper located at 375 Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. Designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, with interiors by Philip Johnson, it is a masterpiece of the International Style of architecture. Known for its minimalist form, bronze-tinted glass, and innovative use of steel and glass, the building set new standards for modern skyscraper design. Its open plaza and setback from the street were pioneering features that influenced future urban planning. The Seagram Building remains an icon of 20th-century modernism and a symbol of elegance and architectural precision.

                        The Portland Building, completed in 1982, is one of the most iconic and controversial examples of Postmodern architecture in the United States. Designed by architect Michael Graves, the building stands at 15 stories tall and serves as a government office for the City of Portland. What sets it apart is its bold use of color, decorative classical elements, and departure from the minimalist norms of Modernism that dominated the 20th century. With stylized columns, keystones, and a striking teal, salmon, and blue color palette, it challenges the glass-and-steel aesthetic of traditional office buildings.

                    <li>
                      At the time of its unveiling, the building sparked significant debate in the architectural community. While some praised it as a revolutionary work that brought ornament and meaning back to architecture, others criticized it for prioritizing symbolism over functionality. Despite its flaws—particularly in terms of materials and interior comfort—it has become a touchstone of architectural history. In 2011, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, recognizing its importance in the evolution of American architecture.

                        In recent years, The Portland Building underwent a major renovation to address its structural and environmental issues while preserving its original design intent. This restoration balanced the need for modern building standards with the preservation of Graves’s vision. Today, the Portland Building stands not just as a workplace, but as a symbol of architectural experimentation and the lasting impact of Postmodernism on public architecture.

                        432 Park Avenue is one of the most recognizable and slender skyscrapers on the New York City skyline. Completed in 2015 and designed by architect Rafael Viñoly, it stands at 1,396 feet (426 meters) tall, making it one of the tallest residential buildings in the Western Hemisphere. Located in Midtown Manhattan, just off Central Park, the tower features a minimalist design with a grid of perfectly square windows that give it a striking, monolithic appearance.

                    <li>
                      The building is an example of the "super-slender" skyscraper trend, designed for ultra-luxury living in vertical form. Its proportions are extraordinary — the building is roughly 15 times taller than its width — and it sits atop a narrow footprint while housing nearly 100 high-end condominium units. Apartments in 432 Park Avenue offer panoramic views of the city, Central Park, and even beyond, thanks to the building's incredible height and carefully calculated structural design, which includes open-air floors to reduce wind sway.  
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Despite its architectural boldness and elite status, the building has attracted criticism and controversy. Residents have reported maintenance and engineering issues, and its symbolism as a home for the global ultra-rich has raised questions about housing inequality and urban planning. Still, 432 Park Avenue remains a prominent architectural statement — a symbol of wealth, ambition, and the changing face of luxury real estate in New York City.
